NAGIOS-MIB
==========

This is the initial set of MIBs for Nagios to allow traps sent from Nagios to
be recognized by other NMSes.

Feedback should be directed to the [Nagios Plugin Development Forum](https://support.nagios.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=35).

Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded the MIB package, you'll need to install libsmi. If you're running RHEL/Cent, this is as easy as

    yum install -y libsmi

Now that you have the proper dependencies, you can run

    make all && make install

* `make all` will run `smistrip` on the modules themselves. Alternatively, you can run `make all && make test` to ensure that the modules were built successfully.

* `make install` will attempt to locate your MIB directory automatically to copy the modules.

If for some reason `make install` fails, you can simply copy the MIBs to their proper location with the following command:

    cp ./MIB/* /path/to/your/mibs/
